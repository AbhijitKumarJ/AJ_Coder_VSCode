You asked to explain:
import re def sanitize_text(text): # Remove non-ASCII characters text = re.sub(r'[^\x00-\x7F]+', '', text) # Remove non-alphanumeric characters except for standard punctuation text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9\s.,!?:;\'"-]+', '', text) return text

AI: The provided Python code is a function called `sanitize_text`, which takes a string input (`text`) and processes it to remove certain unwanted characters. Here is a breakdown of what the code does in detail: 1. **Importing the Regular Expression Module:** ```python import re ``` The `re` module provides support for regular expressions in Python, which allows you to perform search-and-replace operations using patterns. 2. **Defining the Function:** ```python def sanitize_text(text): ``` This line defines the function `sanitize_text`, which will modify the input string that is passed to it. 3. **Removing Non-ASCII Characters:** ```python text = re.sub(r'[^\x00-\x7F]+', '', text) ``` This line uses the `re.sub()` function to search for all characters in the input string `text` that are **not** in the ASCII range. The ASCII range is defined by the hexadecimal values from `0x00` (null character) to `0x7F` (the standard ASCII range). The pattern `r'[^\x00-\x7F]+'` means "match one or more characters that are not ASCII." All such characters are replaced with an empty string, effectively removing them from `text`. 4. **Removing Non-Alphanumeric Characters except for Standard Punctuation:** ```python text = re.sub(r

You asked to optimize:
import re def sanitize_text(text): # Remove non-ASCII characters text = re.sub(r'[^\x00-\x7F]+', '', text) # Remove non-alphanumeric characters except for standard punctuation text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9\s.,!?:;\'"-]+', '', text) return text

AI: The original code uses regular expressions to sanitize a string by removing non-ASCII characters and certain non-alphanumeric characters. However, regular expressions can be costly in terms of performance, especially when processing large texts. Here are some optimizations and explanations for them: ### Optimized Code ```python def sanitize_text(text): # Create a translation table for filtering unwanted characters allowed_chars = set("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789\s.,!?:;\"'-") # Use a list comprehension to filter the text instead sanitized_text = ''.join(char for char in text if char in allowed_chars) return sanitized_text ``` ### Improvements Explained 1. **Use a Set for Allowed Characters**: - In the optimized code, we create a set `allowed_chars` that includes all the characters we want to keep. Sets provide O(1) average time complexity for membership tests. This is considerably faster than using regex, which has a higher overhead. 2. **List Comprehension vs. Regular Expressions**: - Instead of using `re.sub`, we use a list comprehension to traverse the input text, filtering out unwanted characters based on membership in the `allowed_chars` set. This is a more performant approach because it avoids the overhead of regex pattern compilation and matching. 3. **Single Pass**: - The original code makes two passes over the text (one for each regex replacement). The optimized code makes a single pass through the text
